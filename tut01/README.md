## Brainstorming

- agile methodology?
- want to create meme

- what aspects of agile are memeable
- sprints? 
    - scope creep
    - tickets not beign finished
    - moving stuff to next sprint
    - daily standups/retrospective

- waterfall?
    - requirements changing at end of dev
    - going back to drawing board, long process
    - kind of a "boomer" flow

## Research
https://activecollab.com/blog/project-management/agile-project-management-advantages-disadvantages

- hard to onboard due to bad documentation
- progress happens across several cycles, hard to track progress effectively
- alot of overhead (scrum meetings, daily standups, etc)

https://ccaps.umn.edu/story/agile-methodology-advantages-and-disadvantages
- less predictable
- projects can fall off track if developer take on more than they can chew

https://www.planview.com/resources/articles/disadvantages-agile/
- poor resource planning (hard to know what the final cost or time sink the project will be)
- no finite end

https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-waterfall-methodology
- changes for waterfall are difficult
- does not take feedback until almost end of development
- testing does not take place until after completion

https://tryqa.com/what-is-waterfall-model-advantages-disadvantages-and-when-to-use-it/
- working software is not provided until late cycle
- bad for projects with changing requirements

https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/burndown-chart-what-is-it
- pm chart that shows how many tickets are being closed fora  sprint
- can show progress of a team
- usually used by pms to track progress, compare performance b/w sprints/baseline, and determine if team is behind schedule
