## Chapter 2

To properly shape one must provide details that aren't too vague or too concrete. Concrete designs prevent creativity on the designers side and can lead to estimation errors due to some constraints that are not shown in the mockup. Vague designs can lead to misunderstandings as team members wont have enough information from the design. Shaped work must be rough, solved, and bounded.

##  Chapter 3

Setting boundaries is an important aspect of Shape-Up. Features always start as a raw idea, and its the developers jobs to set broad aspects of the feature to make discussions productive. Creating an appetite helps with this - a strict time budget that constrains developers and force them to narrow the scope of the feature in order to deliver on time. This concept is called fixed-time, variable-scope. In addition to setting the appetite, narrowing down the scope is nessessary so that developers do not spend time on aspects of the feature that is not nessessary. 

## Chapter 4

To get elements from a design to a software solution, we can use two types of prototyping: Breadboarding and Fat marker sketches. Breadboarding aims to sketch the important aspects of the feature, and highlighting places (pages), affordances (buttons/fields), and connections (links between places). Fat marker sketches are high level designs of the feature, and the aim is to block out the important aspects of it. Using a fat marker encourages less detail, meaning that design cannot be too concrete.

## Chapter 5

To properly deliver during a certain time window, we need to assess risk and rabbit-holes before development starts. If we do not do this step and unknowns are still present, the time to ship can increase exponentially. Each part we assume is solved should be visited and ask questions about the viability of the part, such as if the part requires new framworks that the team has never worked on before. We also need to declare out of bounds aspects of the feature that will not be implemented in the interest of time, allowing us to cut back on parts of the solution that is not needed. Another way to reduce risk is to present to technical experts, where they can provide feedback and say "Yeah, but..." to anything that may not be feasable.
