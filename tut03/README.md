# Tutorial 3

- Pitch is a direction, not full details
- Suggestion on how to solve it and description, 800 words
	- Teams figure out how to solve the rest with time alotted
	- Person knows what to do by reading
- Shouldnt be too long
- Figures out if the feature is what the customer actually wants
	- Too vague or too constrained is not helpful
	- Dont know what you want until you start building

- Shape up forgets estimates, uses budgets, which allows for flexible pitches

- Anyone can write a pitch
	- Formailized document is used for what the team will do next
	- But anyone can pitch an idea

- Framing: step before shaping, define problem and dont specify solution
	- Pitch defines what the solution is

- Good shaper taken into account multiple problems, find patterns, and create 1 solution that fits all
	- Need to have awareness

- Programmer and designer, although given a suggestion to a solution, they must come up with the actual implementation/concrete solution themselves
	- Coming up with the solution by yourself is gratifying, one of the good parts of Shape-Up

- Rabbit holes look appealing, can get stuck there for a long time
	- Try to avoid those, often times is a trap
	- Adding incremental value to a feature that takes too much time

- Term "science project"
	- broader aspect of rabbit holes
	- whole pitch is a rabbit hole
	- mark a pitch that doesnt have odds of success to shipping compared to other pitches

- Tracer bullet
	- new product, sort of like a pitch but unclear of how it will turn out, see how it lands before going further
	- when are we sure, when do we have concerns, when will something be taken off track
	- dont know if its going to take 2 days or 2 weeks to do
	- to make an informed decision during the betting table
